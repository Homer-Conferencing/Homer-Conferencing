Instructions to install Homer-Conferencing on your system
=========================================================

 The source code of Homer was build for Windows (XP/2003/Vista/7), Linux,
 OS X (Snow Leopard) and FreeBSD. Please use always the latest release
 version from https://github.com/Homer-Conferencing/Homer-Conferencing to
 build Homer or one of its libraries. If you face problems during build
 process, please ask your question(s) via mailing list (you have to be
 subscribed):

    <homer-conf-users@lists.sourceforge.net>

 Most current binaries for all supported system and additional information
 can be found on the offical homepage of Homer:

    http://www.homer-conferencing.com


Installing Homer:
=================

 At least gcc version 4.4 is needed to build Homer or one cf its libraries.
 Additionally, GNU Make and CMake is needed during build process.

 Step 1: create build environment via

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make all"

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries denpending on your 
    current system configuration. All binary files are build without debug 
    symbols and the output is stripped. After this step you can start Homer
    via the command "../bin/Homer".

 Step 2: install files to your system

    > "make install DESTDIR=/foo/bar"

    All created files from step 1 will be installed to "/foo/bar/".
    Libraries will be copied to "/foo/bar/lib" and binaries to "/foo/bar/bin".
    The program icon for Homer will be copied to "/foo/bar/usr/share/Homer".
    The default directory (if no parameter DESTDIR is given) is "/usr/local".


System dependencies:
====================

 To build Homer or one of its libraries several libraries from other projects 
 are needed. The following table gives an overview. Minimum required versions
 and operating system are listed in brackets.

    - Library "HomerBase": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerMonitor": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerGAPI": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerMultimedia": ffmpeg(**), x264
	only for Linux: ALSA,
	only for Windows: Winmm, avicap32, ws2_32
    - Library "HomerConference": sofia-sip (1.12), openssl (1.0)
    - Library "HomerSoundOutput": SDL (1.2), SDL_sound (1.0, SDL_mixer (1.2),
	only for Linux: ALSA,
	only for Windows: Winmm,
	only for OS X: AppKit, AudioUnit, CoreFoundation, Carbon, IOKit, OpenGL
    - Library "Homer" GUI: Qt (4.6)

    **) On some systems the library "ffmpeg" is splitted into separate libraries:
	avutil, avformat, avcodec, avdevice, avfilter, swscale, swresample.


Removing old build data and restoring default data:
===================================================

 You can reset the Homer directories and restore defaults via

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make distclean" (or "make cleaner")

    After these commands all data from the last build run is deleted. You can 
    use "make clean" if you want to remove only the temporary build files and 
    keep the resulting CMake generated Makefile and binaries form the last 
    build run on the disc.


Building Homer with debug symbols / as developer:
=================================================

 Step 1: create build environment via

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make" (or explicit via "make debug")

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries based on the precompiled 
    files from the Homer-Release packages. All binary files are build with debug 
    symbols and the output isn't stripped. If you need the Homer-Release package 
    see https://github.com/Homer-Conferencing/Homer-Release.

 Step 2: install files to your system

    > "make install DESTDIR=/foo/bar"

    You can also install the debug version of Homer. In this case all created 
    files from step 1 will be installed to "/foo/bar/". Libraries will be copied 
    to "/foo/bar/lib" and binaries to "/foo/bar/bin". The program icon for Homer 
    will be copied to "/foo/bar/usr/share/Homer". The default directory (if no 
    parameter DESTDIR is given) is "/usr/local".





Additional information to buil Homer on Windows systems:
========================================================

 To build Homer on Windows you need a minimal Linux environment. At the moment
 each Windows release is built with MSys32, which depends on MinGW32. For 
 compiling gcc version 4.6 and for linking binutils 2.22 are used. Additionally,
 cmake 2.6 is used to generate system depending Makefiles.



Additional information to build Homer on OS X systems:
======================================================

 Current OS X releases of Homer are built with cmake 2.6 for OS X and Apple's 
 Xcode 3.2.6, which includes both gcc and binutils in current versions.
