Instructions for installing Homer-Conferencing on your system
=============================================================

 The source code of Homer was built for Windows (XP/2003/Vista/7), Linux,
 OS X (Snow Leopard) and FreeBSD. Please use always the latest release
 version from https://github.com/Homer-Conferencing/Homer-Conferencing to
 build Homer or one of its libraries. If you face problems during build
 process, please ask your question(s) via mailing list (you have to be
 subscribed):

    <homer-conf-users@lists.sourceforge.net>

 Most current binaries for all supported system and additional information
 can be found on the official home page of Homer:

Install Homer-Conferencing:
===========================

 At least gcc version 4.4 is needed to build Homer or one of its libraries.
 Additionally, GNU Make and CMake is needed during build process.

 Create and install Homer via:

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar"

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries depending on your 
    current system configuration. All binary files are build without debug 
    symbols and the output is stripped. After these steps you can start Homer
    via the command line "./bin/Homer".
    Additionally, all created files will be installed to "/foo/bar/".
    Libraries will be copied to "/foo/bar/lib" and binaries to "/foo/bar/bin".
    The program icon for Homer will be copied to "/foo/bar/usr/share/Homer".
    The default directory (without INSTALL_PREFIX parameter) is "/usr/local".


System dependencies:
====================

 To build Homer or one of its libraries several libraries from other projects 
 are needed. The following table gives an overview. Minimum required versions
 and operating system are listed in brackets.

    - Library "HomerBase": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerConference": sofia-sip (1.12), openssl (1.0)
    - Library "HomerMonitor": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerMultimedia": ffmpeg(**), x264
	                            only for Linux: ALSA, portaudio
	                            only for Windows: Winmm, avicap32, ws2_32,
                                                  portaudio	                            
    - Library "HomerNAPI": no additional dependencies
    - Library "HomerSoundOutput": SDL (1.2), SDL_sound (1.0), SDL_mixer (1.2),
	                            only for Linux: ALSA,
	                            only for Windows: Winmm,
	                            only for OS X: AppKit, AudioUnit, CoreFoundation, 
	                                           Carbon, IOKit, OpenGL
    - Program binary "Homer" GUI: Qt (4.6)

    **) On some systems the library "ffmpeg" is split into separate libraries:
	avutil, avformat, avcodec, avdevice, avfilter, swscale, swresample.


Removing old build data and restoring default data:
===================================================

 You can reset the Homer directories and restore defaults via:

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make distclean"

    After these commands all data from the last build run is deleted. You can 
    use "make clean" if you want to remove only the temporary build files and 
    keep the resulting CMake generated Makefile and binaries form the last 
    build run on the disc.



Install libraries and data files to a different directory than the Homer-Conferencing binary:
=============================================================================================

 It is possible to install all built libraries to an explicitly given directory.
 This can be triggered via:
 
     >"make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar INSTALL_LIBDIR=/foo/bar/lib64 INSTALL_DATADIR=/foo/bar/share"
     
     This will install all libraries to the directory "/foo/bar/lib64" instead of "/foo/bar/lib". 
     Additionally, this will install all data files, e.g. Homer.png, to "/foo/bar/share". 



Additional information to build Homer-Conferencing on Windows systems:
======================================================================

 To build Homer on Windows you need a minimal Linux environment. At the moment
 the Windows releases are built with MSys32, which depends on MinGW32. GCC version
 4.6 and binutils 2.22 are used. Additionally, cmake 2.6 is used to generate system 
 depending Makefiles for the build process.



Additional information to build Homer-Conferencing on OS X systems:
===================================================================

 Current OS X releases of Homer are built with cmake 2.8.* for OS X and Apple's 
 Xcode 4.5.*, which includes both gcc and binutils in current versions.


DEVELOPER: build Homer-Conferencing with debug symbols:
=======================================================

 Create a debug build via:

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make" (alternatively "make debug")

    This will create all needed libraries and binaries based on the pre-compiled 
    files from the Homer-Release package. All binary files are built with debug 
    symbols and the output isn't stripped. If you need the Homer-Release package 
    mail to info@homer-conferencing.com.


DEVELOPER: debug the build process:
===================================

 In general, GNU Make supports the parameter "VERBOSE=1". The Homer build system 
 supports this parameter, too.
  
 Get verbose output during build process via:

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make VERBOSE=1"

 This shows several verbose outputs and often gives a good hint why header files
 weren't found or why linking failed.

 Get even more verbose output during build process via:

    > "cd HomerBuild"
    > "make VERBOSE=2"
