# Homer Conferencing software

Homer is a free cross-platform SIP softphone with video support. It is able to communicate in peer-to-peer mode without any infrastructure in the network. But it also supports SIP servers (PBX boxes). The amount of participants per live video conferences is unlimited by the software.
Besides the conference functions, Homer can also be used for video/audio streaming, recording and screencasting. Video as well as audio stream from files or hardware devices can be streamed for each conference participant individually. Additionally, video/audio stream can be started as separate unicast transmission and send to any host in the Internet with low and high quality settings. Homer can also be used as receiver for video/audio streams. Each received video/audio stream can be recorded to disc and made available for offline playback.
Based on Homer a live streaming of the desktop screen is possible and the captured desktop picture can also be recorded to disc as screencasts.
